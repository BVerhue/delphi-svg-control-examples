Example projects for the SVG control package (commercial and demo)

The SVG control package is a library for rendering SVG graphics in Delphi or FPC/Lazarus applications.

This is a commercial package, but there are also demo packages available, although only for Delphi and unfortunately not for FPC/Lazarus.

This repository contains some example projects for the SVG control package, these should work with the demo packages as well as with the full package.

The demo packages, license info and other info can be found on the website: https://www.bverhue.nl/delphisvg/
